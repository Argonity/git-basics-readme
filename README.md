##Git Repository Basics

###Objectives
1. Define git and explain how it helps programmers control and manage changes
2. Understand how to initialize a new git repository with `git init`
2. Understand how to check the state of your files using `git status`
3. Understand how to stage files to commit using `git add` and `git commit`


###Overview
This lesson is an intro to git and basic commands to get started.

###`git init`
The `git init` command initializes a new git repository in your current directory. What does this mean? Let's say you have a directory called `app`. If you change into that directory in your terminal and type `git init`, you will create a new subdirectory called `.git`. The output in your terminal will read "Initialized empty Git repository in `/your/path/here/app/.git/`" This subdirectory will contain everything needed to start tracking your file changes. Tracking is how `.git` knows about what files are being created or changed. However, at this point, nothing in your project is actually being tracked. So if you create a new file inside your `app` directory called `index.html`, `.git` will not know about it. In order to start tracking files we need another command, which we will talk about shortly.

###`git status`
Befor we move on to actually tracking our files, let's take a look at `git status`. This command, as the name implies, gives the status of your files. Using our example before, when we initialize our new `.git` subdirectory inside our `app` directory and create our `index.html` file, if we type `git status` in our terminal it will read.

```bash
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	index.html

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
Here `git` is telling us, "I see you've created a new file called `index.html`, but it's not yet being tracked. In order to track it, use `git add`.

###`git add`
The `git add` command is how you stage files. Staging is a way of saying your files are ready to be committed. However, this command has to be told what to add. If you just type `git add` by itself in your terminal you will see:

```bash
Nothing specified, nothing added.
Maybe you wanted to say 'git add .'?
```
There are two common ways to tell `git add` what to track.
The first way, as the message before specificed is through `.`. When you pass `.` to `git add` you are saying "track all of the files in the current directory". The second most common way is by passing the actual file name, such as `git add index.html`. In this case we are specifically telling it to track `index.html` and ignore everything else.

After we add our files, we can check our status again with `git status`. Now we will see:

```bash
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   index.html
```
Great, it is showing a new file to commit, which we will do next.

###`git commit`

Now that our staging area is set up, we can commit our changes. Remember that anything still unstaged, meaning any files that you haven't yet added, will not be committed. If we type `git commit` into our terminal, it will launch your default text editor with the following message

```
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#	new file:   index.html
#
```
Here you can add a commit message which would look like this:

```
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#	new file:   index.html
#
"this is our commit message"
```
After saving and exiting this file, Git creates your commit with the commit message.

Alternatively, you can pass `git commit` a message flag like this:
`git commit -m "this is our commit message"`

After hitting enter, Git will commit this the same way as before.
